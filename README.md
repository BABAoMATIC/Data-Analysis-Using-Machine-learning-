# Machine Learning Practical

This repository contains the practical work for the MST575 course, focusing on end-to-end machine learning workflows using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## üìÅ File Structure

## üìå Project Objective

The main goal of this practical is to perform a complete machine learning pipeline on a real-world dataset to predict outcomes using various supervised learning techniques.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Description

**File**: `cell2cell-duke univeristy.csv`  
This dataset is sourced from the Cell2Cell Challenge by Duke University and contains information about telecom customers. It is typically used for customer churn prediction problems.

**Common Features in This Dataset** _(depending on final notebook inspection)_:
- Demographics (age, income)
- Account details (contract length, plan type)
- Usage metrics (call minutes, data usage)
- Churn indicator (target variable)

## üîç Workflow Summary

The notebook follows a typical ML lifecycle including:

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Reading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations and summary statistics

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values
   - Removing duplicates
   - Feature engineering if necessary

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Label encoding / One-hot encoding for categorical variables
   - Feature scaling (e.g., StandardScaler)
   - Splitting into train-test sets

4. **Model Building**
   - Applying machine learning models such as:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Naive Bayes
   - Training and testing models

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC-AUC Curve (if applicable)

6. **Conclusion**
   - Comparison of model performances
   - Best-performing model summary
   - Key insights from the data
